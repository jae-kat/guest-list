# Guestlist

> A React.js project for UpLeveled

<b>This guestlist was created with React and uses Sass for the CSS. The guest data is handled via a Rest API hosted on Heroku.</b>

First and last name input fields have to be filled out for a guest to be added to the list, otherwise an error message will ask the user to provide both. First and last names can be edited, same goes for the attending status.

The list can be filtered to show only attending or only not attending guests.

Each guest, or optionally the entire list can be deleted.
